# Stochastic Estimation Algorithm For Dynamical Variables

A stochastic estimator for dynamical variables as described in arxiv 1812.05120.

In `Guide` you can see how most of the estimators can be set up, while in `Fisher_Information` you can see how to compute and optimize the information content of the control pulses. The `examples` folder contains all code for replication of arxiv 1812.05120.

`hamest` contains the solvers and estimators while `ringham` contains generators for mock data for one particular type of Hamiltonian that we used for testing.
